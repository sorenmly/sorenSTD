Hello! Gamemaker is a really cool engine! But there's lot of things that i wish were a thing in the base Engine, so i made this little library adding some features:

# Features
- Scene Transitions Presets
- Visual FX (Post Processing)
- Math Cool Things (Vectors, Curves...)
- Input Management (This one is really cool)
- Camera Management
- Physics (like verlet ropes)
- (and there will be more!!)

# How to use

Head over the "**Wiki**" tab (not finished yet...)! it has all the info you'll need to use it! I made it easy to use!
The syntax is a little different: i LOVE c++ and i don't love library conflicts by functions and this type of thing, so all of the modules are encapsulated in "namespaces",
like `Input.bind_key()`;

# Note
**I'm not the best programmer on earth (like Terry Davis), so expect some bad things. But hey, this is an open-source project! You can fork this or even PR to make or add something you like!**
